Spoo.me API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain service quality for all users.

## Current Rate Limits

The following rate limits apply to the URL shortening endpoints:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Per Minute"
    icon="clock"
    color="#A855F7"
  >
    maximum **5 short URLs** per IP
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Per Hour"
    icon="hourglass"
    color="#A855F7"
  >
    maximum **50 short URLs** per IP
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Per Day"
    icon="calendar-day"
    color="#A855F7"
  >
    maximum **500 short URLs** per IP
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Affected Endpoints

Rate limits apply to the following endpoints:

- `POST /` - Shorten URLs
- `POST /emoji` - Create emoji URLs

<Note>
  Statistics and export endpoints (`/stats` and `/export`) are not subject to the same rate limits.
</Note>

## Rate Limit Headers

When you make requests to rate-limited endpoints, the response will include headers indicating your current usage:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "You have exceeded the rate limit. Please try again later.",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implement Retry Logic">
    Build retry logic into your application to handle rate limit responses gracefully.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Usage">
    Keep track of your API usage to stay within limits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call API Client Side">
    If possible move the API call to the client side, instead of the server to use the client's IP instead of the same server IP for every request
  </Step>
</Steps>
