MongoDB is a NoSQL database that Spoo.me uses to store URLs, analytics data, and user information. You can either set up a MongoDB server on your own infrastructure or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

<Tip>
We **strongly recommend** using MongoDB Atlas as it offers a generous free tier, automatic backups, and professional management without the complexity of self-hosting.
</Tip>

## MongoDB Atlas Setup (Recommended)

MongoDB Atlas provides a free M0 tier that's perfect for most Spoo.me deployments and can handle thousands of URLs without any cost.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create MongoDB Atlas Account">
    Navigate to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) and sign up for a free account.
    
    <Check>
    Verify your email address when prompted to activate your account.
    </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Create a New Cluster">
    After logging in, you'll see the Atlas dashboard.
    
    1. Click on **"Build a Database"** or **"Create"** button
    2. Choose the **"M0 Sandbox"** option (this is the free tier)
    3. Select your preferred cloud provider (AWS is recommended)
    4. Choose a region closest to your target audience for better performance
    5. Give your cluster a memorable name (e.g., "spoo-me-cluster")
    6. Click **"Create Deployment"**
    
    <Info>
    The cluster creation process typically takes 3-5 minutes to complete.
    </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Database User">
    Once your cluster is ready, you'll see a "Connect to Cluster" dialog.
    
    1. In the **"Username"** field, enter a username (e.g., "spoo-admin")
    2. Click **"Autogenerate Secure Password"** or create your own strong password
    3. **Important**: Copy and save the password immediately - you won't see it again
    4. Click **"Create Database User"**
    
    <Warning>
    Store your username and password securely. You'll need these credentials for your connection string.
    </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Network Access">
    Set up IP address access for your deployment.
    
    1. Click **"Choose a connection method"**
    2. Select **"Drivers"** 
    3. In the IP Access List, click **"Add a Different IP Address"**
    4. Click **"Allow access from anywhere"** (adds 0.0.0.0/0)
    5. Click **"Confirm"**
    
    <Warning>
    While "Allow access from anywhere" is convenient for development, consider restricting IP access to your server's IP address in production for better security.
    </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Get Connection String">
    Now you'll get your MongoDB connection string.
    
    1. Choose **"Node.js"** as your driver
    2. Copy the connection string - it should look like this:
    
    ```
    mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
    ```
    
    3. Replace `<username>` with your database username
    4. Replace `<password>` with your database password
    5. Save this complete connection string securely
    
    <Check>
    Your final connection string should look like:
    `mongodb+srv://spoo-admin:yourpassword@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`
    </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Connection String Security

Your MongoDB connection string contains sensitive credentials and should be treated as a secret.

<Warning>
**Never commit your connection string to version control or share it publicly.** Always use environment variables to store database credentials.
</Warning>

### Environment Variable Usage

When deploying your Spoo.me instance, you'll use your connection string as the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

## Alternative: Self-Hosted MongoDB

If you prefer to host MongoDB on your own server, you can install MongoDB Community Edition:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Ubuntu/Debian">
```bash
# Import MongoDB public GPG key
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-7.0.asc | sudo apt-key add -

# Add MongoDB repository
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list

# Update package database
sudo apt-get update

# Install MongoDB
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org

# Start MongoDB service
sudo systemctl start mongod
sudo systemctl enable mongod
```

Your connection string would be:
```
mongodb://localhost:27017
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">
# Download MongoDB Community Edition
https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

# Install MongoDB command line tools
https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools

# Start MongoDB server
```bash
mongod --dbpath "C:\your-preffered-path" --port 27017
```

# Connection string
`mongodb://localhost:27017`

</Tab>

<Tab title="Docker">
```bash
# Run MongoDB in Docker container
docker run -d \
  --name mongodb \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  -v mongodb_data:/data/db \
  mongo:7.0

# Connection string
mongodb://localhost:27017
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
Self-hosted MongoDB requires additional configuration for security, backups, and monitoring. MongoDB Atlas handles these concerns automatically.
</Info>

## Verification

To verify your MongoDB setup is working correctly:

1. **For MongoDB Atlas**: Use the "Connect" button in your cluster dashboard and test the connection
2. **For self-hosted**: Run `mongosh` command to connect to your local instance

<Check>
Once you have your `MONGODB_URI` connection string ready, you can proceed to the next step of setting up webhooks or choosing your deployment method.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Connection timeout errors">
- Verify your IP address is in the Atlas IP Access List
- Check if your network firewall blocks MongoDB ports (27017)
- Ensure your connection string format is correct
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication failed">
- Double-check your username and password in the connection string
- Ensure the database user has proper permissions
- Verify the database name if you're connecting to a specific database
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SSL/TLS connection issues">
- MongoDB Atlas requires SSL connections by default
- Ensure your connection string includes the SSL parameters
- For self-hosted MongoDB, configure SSL certificates if needed
</Accordion>
