## Post-Deployment Configuration

After successful deployment on any platform:

<Steps>
<Step title="Test Core Functionality">

    <Check>
    Verify that webhook notifications appear in your Discord channels.
    </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor Performance">
    Most platforms provide built-in monitoring:
    
    - **Vercel**: Analytics tab in project dashboard
    - **Railway**: Metrics tab in service dashboard  
    - **Render**: Metrics section in service dashboard
    - **Koyeb**: Monitoring tab in service dashboard
    
    <Tip>
    Set up alerts for downtime or high error rates to stay informed about your service health.
    </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Custom Domain (If Needed)">
    If you want to use your own domain:
    
    1. Purchase a domain from a registrar
    2. Proxy with cloudflare or any other DNS manager for faster DNS propagation
    3. Configure DNS records as instructed
    4. Wait for DNS propagation (usually a few minutes if you use cloudflare)
</Step>
</Steps>

## Limitations of Cloud Deployment

While cloud deployment is convenient, there are some limitations to consider:

<Warning>
**Limited Customization**: You cannot modify the application code or add custom features like analytics integrations or custom SEO elements.
</Warning>

- **No code modifications**: The deployed version is exactly as provided in the repository, except when using vercel because they create a private fork on your gitHub account before deploying.
- **Platform dependencies**: Your deployment depends on the chosen platform's reliability and pricing
- **Resource limits**: Free tiers have usage limits that may affect high-traffic deployments

<Info>
If you need more control or customization, consider [Docker deployment](/self-hosting/deployment/docker-deployment) or [local development](/self-hosting/deployment/local-development) instead.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Build/Deployment Failures">
**Symptoms**: Deployment fails during build process

**Solutions**:
- Verify all environment variables are correctly set
- Check that your MongoDB connection string is valid
- Ensure webhook URLs are properly formatted
- Review build logs for specific error messages
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Database Connection Errors">
**Symptoms**: App loads but can't create/retrieve URLs

**Solutions**:
- Test your MongoDB connection string manually
- Verify your MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist includes 0.0.0.0/0
- Check that your database user has proper permissions
- Ensure your cluster is running and accessible
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhook Not Working">
**Symptoms**: Forms submit but no Discord notifications

**Solutions**:
- Test webhook URLs manually using curl
- Verify Discord channels still exist
- Check that webhook permissions haven't been revoked
- Ensure webhook URLs are correctly configured in environment variables
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom Domain Issues">
**Symptoms**: Custom domain doesn't work or shows SSL errors

**Solutions**:
- Verify DNS records are correctly configured
- Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
- Check that your domain registrar supports the required record types
- Ensure SSL certificates have been issued (usually automatic)
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Cost Considerations

All recommended platforms offer generous free tiers:

- **Vercel**: Free for personal projects, very high limits
- **Railway**: $5 credit covers ~5-7 months of usage
- **Render**: 750 free hours per month (enough for continuous hosting)
- **Koyeb**: Limited free tier, paid plans start at $5/month

<Tip>
For most personal or small business use cases, the free tiers are more than sufficient. You can always upgrade later if needed.
